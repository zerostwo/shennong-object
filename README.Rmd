The goal of `ShennongObject` is to provide an S4 class, `Shennong`, designed for storing and analyzing multi-modal single-cell and bulk omics data. It builds upon the `MultiAssayExperiment` framework, offering a structured way to manage multiple assays (e.g., RNA, ATAC), data layers within assays (e.g., counts, normalized data, scaled data), dimensional reductions (e.g., PCA, UMAP), sample metadata, and analysis provenance.

The design of `ShennongObject` was inspired by the structured API of the `Seurat` package for single-cell data, and draws conceptual influence from the `tidyomics` philosophy to support tidyverse-style workflows for omics analysis.

## Installation

To install the development version from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("zerostwo/shennong-object")
```

## Quick Start Example

This is a basic example showing how to create a `Shennong` object:

```{r example}
library(ShennongObject)

# 1. Create dummy RNA counts matrix (genes x samples)
genes <- paste0("Gene", 1:100)
samples <- paste0("Sample", 1:10)
rna_counts <- matrix(
  rpois(1000, lambda = 10),
  nrow = 100,
  dimnames = list(genes, samples)
)
# Make it sparse for demonstration
rna_counts[sample(1000, 300)] <- 0
rna_counts <- as(rna_counts, "dgCMatrix")

# 2. Create dummy sample metadata
sample_metadata <- data.frame(
  condition = sample(c("Control", "Treated"), 10, replace = TRUE),
  batch = factor(sample(c("A", "B"), 10, replace = TRUE)),
  row.names = samples
)

# 3. Create the Shennong object
sn_obj <- sn_initialize_shennong_object(
  counts = rna_counts,
  metadata = sample_metadata,
  project = "QuickStart",
  assay = "RNA" # Name for the primary assay
)

# Print basic summary
print(sn_obj)
```
